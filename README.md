This is a MS Edge extension that adds a button for random words for wordle, because i like to mix up my opening guess every day.

I realise that I could've gotten the possible guesses text file from various online sources but the file is small so w/e and you can customize what guesses you want that way.

TO DO:
- Implement Custom word lists for people who want variety but still want to use strong words
